everybody’s got a secret,
would you like to tell me
yours?

I can’t leave,
I can’t turn away from a world like this one
I could save myself,
or let you save me

everybody’s got a secret,
and I don’t know if I want to tell you
mine

I’m just made of 
poorly written
messy, meaningless notes

I’m sitting on a bed that doesn’t feel mine
where I scream, in silence
I thought I was that book
you know
the one you misjudged by its cover

I thought I was a survivor
I’m just an asshole, all martyrdom
and no salvation
no redemption, not for me

I choose a mask between many
the most comfortable for every situation
I’m not afraid of anything
because on the inside, I’m empty
I stage battles to count my wins
I don’t care about living forever
I just want to die a winner

I live a play, a recital
and I’m good at it, I think I’m the best
the best, at being wrong

I get off the stage and
nobody knows who I am

neither do I

and every time, I get closer 
to that rock bottom
fists clenched
at the bottom of my abyss

and would you even know

sometimes I’m just so far away that
I don’t even know what I’d fear the most

to not find myself anymore
or to find myself again

I’m next to forget everything
I’m next to be forgotten

I’m tearing apart old pictures of me
thousands of eyes stare at me 
from the blankets’ folds, from the shadows

around me, the plaster begins to peel off the walls 
revealing dirty, cracked bricks

the ceiling is a cobweb
a multitude of spiders is descending toward me

behind the photos were written notes
but they get blurry under salty drops

my ears are ringing
my heart is pounding
my head is bursting

and I just don’t care

everybody’s got a secret
and I just don’t know
if I want 
to know

yours
