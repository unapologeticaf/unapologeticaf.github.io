I know what it means to only have
leaves, grass, concrete, cardboard to sleep on

I am afraid of the roads at night
and I know what it’s like
to look straight into headlights
wondering what’s behind them
wondering if they’ll hit you

I know what it means to be thirsty, hungry

I know what it’s like not to have 
any place 
to call home

as I am
and always will be

stray
