each and everybody of us
has their own mountain to climb

everybody has that dream

but somebody is actually chasing it
backpacking through hardship
starving off failures
empty pockets and
mind overflowing with
ambition

holding their head high
looking up to the stars

we all know, deep down
that we can do it

we can reach that peak

but somebody is actually
grazing their knees
flaying their fists
burning their muscles

without care

these people are actually
piles of scars and a collection of
falls and failures
so many as
the times they got back up

holding their head high
looking up to the stars

they keep on going,
they face thorns and hunger
rocks and thirst

they climb mirrors
jump off cliffs
they just fucking fly

until
a misstep
a stumble, into darkness
too high to fall gracefully
into the void, fear, horror

holding their heads high
one final look at the stars
among which they now too 
shine
