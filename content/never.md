I once wanted to surprise you by showing up at your place to cheer you up
but turned the car back halfway
when you told me you just wanted to be alone

there's a chat on Telegram with a roleplaying adventure I had ready for you

I love you

I started a drawing of us together

I was yours even before we first met

when you didn't text me that morning
I knew it was over

I kept upvoting all your posts
for a while
