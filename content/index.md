I'm Gabriele, also known as [[unapologeticaf|unapologetic.af]], [[flygohr|Flygohr]], Liar, Aldebaran1317, or [[stray_scribbles|Stray]] online. this is my littleÂ [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought#what-is-digital-gardening), or kitchen junk drawer, my attempt at collecting everything I do in one place

last updated: 2025-01-06

my goals for this life are:
- put my creative stuff out there: be it with illustrations, writing, poetry, games, or tattoos
- being my own boss, even if I end up giving myself overtime everyday
- create a community of like-minded, creative, nerdy generalist people around my work

I've started blogging here, I might turn this into a newsletter one day. in the meantime, just bookmark the page ;)

I'm currently:
- writing short poems for my book [[tags/stray|stray (poetry book)]]. I'll be looking into publishing it this year
- just ended my 251 days streak of one drawing a day for my [[stray_scribbles]] Instagram page. I'll be uploading all the drawings here in the upcoming weeks
- polishing up a [[Liar Tarots|tarot deck]] (now complete) featuring my OC [[Liar]]. I'm also writing and illustrating his [[Liar's story (comic)|lore]], but I'm now focusing on setting up the printable files for the cards
- working full time as a digital fantasy artist under the art name [[flygohr|Flygohr]]. I recently revamped my main website https://www.flygohr.com
- preparing to move [my small Substack publication](https://flygohr.substack.com/) over to ConvertKit for a more marketing oriented experience
- preparing to become a tattoo artist. I just passed the sanitary and hygiene exam required for tattoo and piercing practitioners, and I'm now going to practice on fake skin
- playing a lot of the tabletop game [[Nemesis]], it's been very fun with my gf and flatmates
- setting up my own version of the TTRPG [[Cairn]], as I plan to have one or two simple campaigns running for gf and friends in '25. as soon as I have something I'll put it up for download
- playing [[Hollow Hike]] by myself
- all this talk about ttrpgs has me wondering if I can put up something custom on itch.io this year
- I would also like to create [my childhood RPG](https://github.com/unapologeticaf/childhood-rpg), the project is currently on hiatus but downloadable from [my GitHub page](https://github.com/unapologeticaf/). I might open this up for collabs in the future

I'm also:
- I just finished reading [[The Winner Effect]] and I'm now onto [[A Life Worth Living]]. I'm also reading [[Superfans]] as I'm looking forward to creating a community for my work
- re-reading [[Fullmetal Alchemist]], and playing catch-up with [[One Piece]] (currently on chapter 1135)
- watching [[Squid Game 2]] with my gf, just finished the last episode
- watching YouTube essays as I do drawings for work. I'm currently obsessed with economics and sustainable productivity
- playing some [[Wild Rift]] after getting tired of [[League of Legends]]
- on a 690+ days streak on Duolingo lmao

collections:
- [[tags/read|books I've read]]
- [[Allies|allies]]
