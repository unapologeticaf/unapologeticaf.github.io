exterior, night

a murder of crows is feasting on a pile of meat and brains

their croak resounds raspy, as they gorge on my eyes

you will hear no swansong coming from my darkness

I picked evil
do you think you can hurt me?

I come from the underground
like cockroaches and worms

I can die
and feel like coming home.
