darling
darling, save your breath
you know, it’s not ending now
not soon, anyways
I’m not falling
I’m not bowing
as if I was capable

darling, you’d like to know my plans
if only I had some
if only I could, share them

I’m just selfish
a parasitic asshole
darling, I’m that unkept promise

like us, finding
excuses in songs
I know you are too kind
to tell me to fuck off

darling, your old photos are on fire
with your innocence
why, why do you always want to go
why, why do you never stay

I feel the paper burning
between my fingers
under this lead sky
if only I could

maybe you already realized
that there’s always
just one word missing
I ain’t made for love
so try to steal that from me
read between the lines

darling, I’m going to catch your breath
I’m just waiting for my turn
to slip inside, break your walls

darling,
did you take your meds
