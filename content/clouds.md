your thoughts are thickening, like clouds. now melting away in the cold, snowflakes of sorrow

you are gasping for air, struggling to stay afloat in an ocean of black oil. the pitch black waves are clinging onto you, they won’t leave you

what if I set the sea on fire? 

your dreams are like rain, slipping through your fingers
as if you ever had the courage to chase them
and you watch them plummeting, from the heights of your crimson sky
ready to shatter to the ground

you know, one of us is definitely wrong
I extend my hand

what if I was holding a knife in the other one?

your desire is burning, consuming you from the inside
your willpower is like poison ivy, it’s infecting everything inside you
opening cracks in that wall, in that armor you carry like a shield

maybe it will break
you should jump anyway
it’s soft. I’ll catch you

what if I step away at the last second?

your days are gone, way before you even started living them
you’ve become an hostage, spared by your own anxiety
you’d just want to disappear. go anywhere, but here
and I say, please catch that train. run away

when you’ll come back, I’ll be here

and what if I don’t wait for you?
