your resounding failure
still echoes through the void
I have inside

you and I
two hearts at the edge of the world
the end justifying our means
now more sick, poisoned
more conscious 
of this
lie

I'm hiding behind a pale mask
behind it, death
converting our lies
in new truths

we'll get no burial
for this emptiness
not even for yourself

you wake up
from the painful screams
coming from that slaughterhouse
that your brain is

we just bleed monsters
like me

forget my name, my face
it happens, when we try to fix
such broken things
it happens
when you don't listen
to me

never been so easy
to ignore my voice
yet, you have my grin
sewn onto your lips

you and I
two hearts at the edge of the world
