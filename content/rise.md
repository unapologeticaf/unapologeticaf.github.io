I'm freezing
ankle-deep in the cold sea waves

walking
I watch the sun setting
surrendering to the night

it's taking forever
like you

I just seek my reckoning
I am fire, I rise in flames
even if it's cold, even if it's
dark

I burn through everyone
leaving only ashes behind

never looking back
because Iâ€™m a liar and
a thief

I just fake
being like everyone else
while I steal your words
your love, your trust
your dreams

away

it's just that I'm tired, tired
of hearing people talking
while saying nothing

I am just waiting for the next
tragedy
the next chance to scream
to step heavy on the gas
to punch someone in the face

to kiss that beauty

the next chance
to cry, and to
finally feel something

the next chance,
to tell that lie

the next excuse for writing bad poetry, for
sending sad texts

to rip my heart apart
and build a new, better one

I am alone, but I share your tears
now, I am your fears and dreams
we are one, for a brief moment
freezing, while
scorched by my inner flame
walking into an endless sunset
between madness and

sadness
