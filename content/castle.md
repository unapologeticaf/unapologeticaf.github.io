here we go again. it’s cold outside, that cold you won’t ever stop loving. the clanging thunders almost cover the sound of your thoughts. heavy rain starts shattering your hopes for the day. you look past the foggy window, the creaking of the fire seems so distant, as if it wasn’t in the next room

as if those weren’t all the words you ever wrote, the ones burning with rage. you made your own hell. as if paradise was everything you wanted to live for. I mean, it’s your choice, to stay locked up, in your castle, oh, my queen

it’s your responsibility, to love what you have. your responsibility, to change what you don’t love. never settle
feel the rain knocking on your windows, feel the wind howling. don’t feel guilty. again, it’s your choice, to let your dreams rot outside. as if you didn't’ love them, so, you know. to get true happiness you can only risk to be torn apart, slaughtered by this life. I get you don’t want to. as if living was everything

you look behind, to that door you nailed with logs, ropes, locks, to make sure it stays shut. you shiver, cold sweat rolling down your spine. as if you weren’t sick, feverish. as if someone could ask you to come inside

dream

nobody is going to
nobody will
insist

you know, it’s like when you realize that you really want to solve your own issues. I mean, once all that shit is cleaned up, once all those notes will be ashes, what will be left of you? you always knew it, you always got scared by ghosts. so you ended up living with them. as if feeling something was important

you try to smile at your reflection, a barebones copy of your former self. and you remember, somebody once told you. that we all, everybody, we are just all smiling with a gun to our head. without knowing what we truly want, we end up with a bunch of shit we don’t care about. as if, having something was the point

as if you weren’t your own worst enemy. precluding yourself of every possible risk, oh, my queen. outside is pouring cats and dogs, but inside, your castle is burning to the ground. you were so naive. thinking that any reality could satisfy you. you stupid, leaving your dreams to freeze to death. 

again, as if living was everything
