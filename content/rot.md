the forest is made of dead, rotting trees
a pale, half moon hangs covered in thick clouds
the undergrowth creaks under your quick steps
your naked body, scratched and bruised
your eyes wide open, the breath condensing fast
your heart racing, every shadow a threat
a monster, a demon, a hidden fear
you run from tree to tree, and there’s just no end to it

you can’t remember who was wrong
you just can't remember who started it
you can’t remember where you lost your innocence
if it was that stone you threw
that lie you told
that cheek you didn’t turn

your feet finally touch a soft spot of grass
and you raise your head, to the gorgeous woods
in front of you
you allow yourself to slow down
your breath smooths itself out
while you just walk, in between the beautiful trees

maybe you won't have to run forever
maybe you'll be able to finally rest

but it’s cold, it’s dark, it starts to snow and
as the snowflakes touch ground
you start to feel warm
something is not right

your heart starts pounding again
you realize
you’ve been watching
ashes falling down from the sky
this whole time

you see smoke rising from behind the trees
and all around you, the forest is burning
a red ember reflected in your wide stare

flames scorch your arms
your eyes feel dryer than ever
the heat is unbearable, and you fall to your knees

and as soon as you think you are done for
you feel something
running down your cheek
a long-lost sensation
you thought that it was a tear
that you were finally, finally going to cry

but it was just rain
it was just the forest, starting to rot again
it was just the monsters, the demons, the fears
back to hunting you
