it’s like pulling a trigger
in the name of love
black figures, black robes
I welcome you

it’s blood, following you
poisoned waters, everywhere
be, seek,
what could you become?

if only you could understand
without passion
without determination
it’s just self destruction

I, bleak corpse
I welcome you
