I was born wrong
frustrated
antisocial

I’m climbing my way up

I will make mistakes
I will fall, and 

I will just get myself up

I catch my breath

I’m that voice 
you didn’t want to hear
I’m your anxiety
slowly turning into horror
I’m your prayers
your desire.

shut it down
shut yourself down
shut yourself down

with me

I’m just a meat bag, burning from the inside
I’m rotting under the scorching sun
sometimes I dream, of being born
deaf, or
blind

you can try to bury me
you’ll have to look at me rising back up

ink and fog, flames and tar
feathers and ashes
and every time, you’ll see me
spread my darkened wings

controversial
compromised

I’m the bullet inside a loaded gun
like a caged beast breaking free
could be the spark at the bottom of the volcano

light it up
light yourself up
light yourself up

with me

it’s just that I was born wrong
frustrated
antisocial

I’m hitting rock bottom
I feel fragile
I can’t make another mistake
I can’t make it up anymore.

I stop my breathing
I’ve never been afraid of pulling that trigger
