the sky is grey, empty, cold
its sunset throws metallic reflections
on that desert you hide inside

your empty thoughts
your insomniac abortions
gutted outside under starless nights

hiding behind your steel there’s
obsidian, and never-ending days

it’s raining blood now
it hammers your head
it rips your heart
leaves you breathless

you barely remember the snow
from that picture, the one you couldn’t understand
you are wonderful, while you lick your own wounds
while crying salt all over them

doesn’t matter, you whisper
without hate

and you almost, almost throw up

the air is thick with iron
a fragile, porcelain dawn
shines from behind your walls

and almost, almost
makes your hell disappear

your eyes are wide open
shining through your dirty hair
flies are trying to eat them
dark circles are trying to dig them out
you almost, almost

can’t see anymore
