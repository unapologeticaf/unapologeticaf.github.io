I will be calm
before the storm

I will be sitting in the dark
sharpening my tools

sparks that light up my eyes
blind
useless
like your shield
like your smell

I will be sitting by a corner
trying to understand how 
to put my soul on a slip of paper

silently
like your naked steps in the snow

I’ll be there
when you’ll leave

I’ll take the fall
carelessly

I’ll break that shell you thought you could
be
I’ll dismantle that wall you thought you could
have

sharp edges
ready to fight
hunter
prey

with all those slips of paper
I could only make wings
because
I’ll be flying so high that I’ll almost
almost

fall

I’ll be watching you
you'll be losing yourself
drowning in an ocean of sorrow

you’ll be grasping for air
hopeless
faceless
lost in a dark pit
with you guts full of pills

I’ll spread my wings
so high, so high
that I’ll almost
almost

fall.

I’ll end up shining
supernova

I’ll be your light
in your dark

I’ll be your lighthouse
so far up through
your desperate sea

I’ll be your calm
before the storm
