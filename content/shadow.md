there’s a shadow
that’s been walking by your side
since forever
unknown
ghastly

this shadow knows

it reeks of tears, and
masturbation
blood, and
fists clenched tight

this shadow knows
you

you showed her everything
everything you couldn’t show
us

as if
you could hide from her

invisible
elusive
queen of corpses and 
ghosts

you can’t see her
she can’t touch you but
she can hear you

she can find you

you belong to her

turn off the lights
bring her with you

ears ringing
she’s right behind you

it’s the fading silhouette of a whisper
in the dying darkness of your wake

it’s a black shiver that runs down your spine

this shadow knows
knows who you are 
when nobody is watching
