## chapter 1: some background

I don't have (and don't want) a regular job

I am self employed, and for now, for a living, I do fantasy art commissions under the art alias [[Flygohr]]

but I have many interests, with knowledge in various areas including:
- 3D
- music and audio
- writing and worldbuilding
- programming
- game design
- fitness

at the moment, as you've seen on the [[index|homepage]], I am:
- writing and drawing for personal projects, incl. a poetry book and a tarot deck
- doing art commissions for a living, managing a dozen clients at any given time
- working out regularly, reading, focusing on growing as a person
- playing tabletops and coming up with game design ideas
- preparing to become a tattoo artist, just got my license

on top of that, I have a history of depression, anxiety, dysfunctional childhood and adolescence, alcohol abuse, burnout, and some other bad stuff

I'm not on medication, but to stay functional I need to make exercise, mindfulness, and rest a priority. this can eat up half of my day easily

I don't work 8 hours per day. I don't think I even work 6. I just can't

I'm not lazy. as you'll see in the following chapters, and given my situation and upbringings, I do more than 99% of people in the 1st world. but I've been dealing with burnout and overwhelm for most of my adult life. and life has loved throwing me curve ball after curve ball. it's been hard af, and while part of my current setup has been dictated by circumstances, I can't lie

I just don't want to integrate in this stupid capitalist system. I don't want money to be the centerpiece of my life. I don't want a boss. I don't want my soul to be drained dry by this system. this is on me

I'm taking responsibility for:
- the burnout
- the debts with friends and family
- the failures
- the stress, the long hours
- the sacrificing of playtime

additionally, I want to rest when I feel like I need rest. I want to drop work at a moment's notice, be flexible, in case family, friends, or my girlfriend need my help. or in case unforeseen events happen. or just to get groceries when there's less crowd at the supermarket, you know. I can work from home, on the go, at my gf's house

I hope what I'm saying is making sense

I developed a system that allows me to do more with less time, by being incredibly focused and by optimizing my routines to the extreme
