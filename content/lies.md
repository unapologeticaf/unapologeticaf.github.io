we’ve both seen hell
we’ve chosen a steep road, full of obstacles. many have tried, most have failed

but I wish I could translate my thoughts into paper and ink, for you to read
all my fears, all my dreams
all my love
I wish those words could always be there for you when you need them
when you don’t, too

because sometimes, I’m not sure in the end we’ll still have
each other
