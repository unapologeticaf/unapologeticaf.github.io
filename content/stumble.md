I stand at the edge of a cliff
below, a sea of dreams and hopes. the future I worked so hard for 
behind me, a darkness made of hardship and forgotten tragedies. I can still hear the painful sound of my knees scraping on concrete. of my punches, thrown at the wall

I take a few steps back, and I can feel the shadows trying to hug me, shivering down my spine. but I don’t look, my eyes set on the waves down below
I’m young, ambitious
I know only winners are allowed to live this cruel, merciless world
and if you want to win others, you first need to win yourself

another step back. one more. behind me, I can hear the stygian cloud screaming, begging for me to turn back
but I have wings, made of paper, blood and ink
I made a bet, on myself, and it’s looking a lot like throwing myself off that cliff
I run, I catch speed, I didn’t even know I could run this fast

as if I was at gunpoint

and, as I prepare to jump
finally
I

stumble
