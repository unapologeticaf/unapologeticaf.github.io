Circles ✅
The sky is grey, empty, cold.
Its sunset throws metallic reflections
on that desert you hold inside.


Your empty thoughts,
your insomniac abortions,
gutted outside starless nights.
Hiding behind your steel there’s
obsidian, and never ending days.


It’s raining blood now.
It hammers your head,
it rips your heart,
leaves you breathless.


You barely remember the snow
from that picture, the one you couldn’t understand.
You are wonderful, while you licki your own wounds.
While crying salt all over them.


Doesn’t matter, you whisper.
Without hate.
And you almost, almost throw up.


The air is thick with iron.
A fragile, porcelain dawn
shines from behind your walls.
And almost, almost
makes your hell disappear


Your eyes are wide open,
shining through your dirty hair.
Flies are trying to eat them.
Dark circles are trying to dig them out.
You almost, almost


can’t see anymore.
