I’ve spent so many nights walking through sleeping cities
I seldom slept, watching freight trains pass by
I spent so much time alone, in the dark, that darkness is a part of me now
sometimes, I don’t even know if I’m awake
maybe that’s why
my nightmares feel so real

the light is overrated
as if I had a path I needed to follow
and when I turn it off, I can finally stop seeing the shadows

I now can’t tell days from nights
maybe because monsters look the same in both
maybe, I can’t tell the monsters apart
from me
sometimes, I don’t even know if I’m awake
maybe, it’s because the night sky has been
my home, my roof, for so long now

who cares?
I don’t need a home, anyways
who cares if I lost my light, I’m going to shine through anyways
sometimes, I don’t even know if I’m awake

maybe, it’s because
I made of dreams
my way of life
