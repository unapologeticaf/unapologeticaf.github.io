this is for you

for you, refusing to be a slave
never bending
beaten, chained
jailed and
it’s not like you are going to break
free

this is for you, fire thief
you are a warning

you being dead, or alive
good, or bad
it doesn’t matter
as long as you keep fighting

as if we were at war

this rain
shattering onto the battlefield
stripping it of every hope
washing away your blood

as Icarus
it fascinates you
you want to know where everything comes from and then
wings made of wax melting

it’s you, shattering to the ground now

life gives, and deaths takes it away
let her practice more

this is for you
victim of your own self

you and your boots, your shoes, your reason to live

dirty, ragged, torn
you chase people, without ever being able
to catch them
boredom to run after you
deep, dark, macabre

it’s the tedium, understood only by
who knows that the crown is just
someone’s self sacrifice

like ashes, that slowly spiral down
breaking into coffee stains
into tears, rolling down your cheeks
to your soft lips
they welcome the salt
you twitch them, grimacing

in the end, your wings will not melt
not that one time
and then, you’ll close your eyes
you’ll hold your breath,
start running towards that edge

and you’ll jump
