thorns climbing my arm
as we cuddle
shy

thorns encircling this hug
sweet and painful 
as only love can be

a life of needles keeping us apart
as if we were born of pain

thorns in my lungs
as I kiss you
blood trickling down
from our lips

night, interior
we play, panting, rubbing
licking our wounds
sucking our fears
wrapping our hearts with 
barbed wire

miracles don’t exist
it’s just us, carrying them out
making of our thorns
a crown
