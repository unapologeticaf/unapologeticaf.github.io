you were younger than me

but it was you
turning on the lights for me
so I could go upstairs
'cause I was afraid of the dark

it was you, watching over me
hiding in the woods
'cause I was playing with the GameBoy
and mom didn't want me to

and now
as I go to sleep
it's still you, watching over me

hanging from the ceiling
