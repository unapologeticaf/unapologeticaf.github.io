you know that feeling

you’ve met so many people, and yet you know nothing about yourself
you are barely looking at your own life, wasting it away
nobody is going to make a movie on that shit
nobody is going to read your story, if you don’t start writing it yourself

you know that feeling
of your days shortening, your hours disappearing
the fleeting nature of time, like sand slipping through your fingers

like sand, your walls break down, crumbling
your precious facade, shattering to the ground
that feeling

here I am, hiding in between the lines
like sand, running in the wind past the car window

now that nothing is changing
I’ll change skin
I’ll change homes
I’ll change countries

now that nothing is changing

I’ll change you
