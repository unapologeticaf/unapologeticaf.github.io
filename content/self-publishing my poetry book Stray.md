I am putting together a poetry book. I have written short poems and stories for the last 15 years or so, and wanted to collect some in a book

you can read the poems [[tags/stray|stray (poetry book)|here]]

I want to self-publish, I don't want to go through an editor or publisher
## chapter 1: exploring options
I have two options:
- either I order a bunch of copies and sell / ship them myself
- or I go with a print on demand service

| option                    | pros                                                                              | cons                                                                    |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **print and ship myself** | - branding, leaflets, cards, signatures<br>- more control on environmental impact | - inventory management<br>- couriers<br>- upfront costs<br>- accounting |
| **print on demand**       | - no inventory<br>- no upfront costs<br>- no payments / invoices management       | - no branded website<br>- hard to avoid big corpo                       |
in short, printing and shipping myself would allow me to make everything nicer and customized but it costs more, and it takes time and resources

printing on demand could still get me something nice, without sacrificing time and resources I don't have at the moment. it will take a while to find a good fit tho
## chapter 2: exploring POD
ideally print on demand, because I can't afford to pre-order a hundred copies and then sell them myself

print on demand meaning that the book is printed once whenever someone orders it, instead of being printed in bulk. also no inventory management

I don't want to use the most widespread option, Amazon's KDP, because it's Amazon and I'm tired of billionaires

I decided to watch a few vids and read some threads on indie publishing, to see what my alternatives are

as I was researching this, I also started to think about HOW to actually sell and distribute the book

while the book will be free to grab here, I can't print it and ship it for free, you know

so, it turns out most websites integrate with Shopify, which is another huge corp that I don't want to touch

but I also don't want to use an API and program a whole e-commerce website from scratch with payment options, privacy policies, etc

this is getting extremely difficult real fast

I need to find a website that
- has worldwide shipping
- prints on demand, so I don't have to manage inventory
- has a public shop where I can list my book
- doesn't sell or distribute through Amazon or any other large corp

I don't really care about my share of the profit since I'll be putting the PDF here for free, but I want to use a fair service that still gets me something

services I'm investigating:
- IngramSpark
	- big but average quality
	- low cut
	- poor customer service
- 48hbooks
	- not really POD
	- special editions, gloss, foil, etc
	- costly
	- you set the cut
- Barnes & Nobles
	- might be using IngramSpark lmao
- Lulu
	- has lots of integrations
	- lots of binding options
	- weeks of delay
- Blurb
	- book templates
	- low paper weights
- Bookvault -> https://bookvault.app/
	- integrates with website
- Mixam
- Streetlib
- if I remember correctly, there's also Printful, that could integrate with my Gumroad store
	- nope, they only do covers

I decided to arrange them in a table so I could more easily keep track of them and their properties

| Service                                        | Worldwide shipping                                                                                                                                      | Public shop                            | POD books                     | Perceived quality (1-5) | Indie-ness (0-4) |

## chapter 3: trying Lulu
ok, it seems it will be POD

I found three services I'd like to explore
- IngramSpark
- Lulu, currently my favorite
- Mixam

in the following days I'll check out their options and see if they can be a good fit for my poetry book

I'm signing up for Lulu first. here's how it went:
- verified my email and started exploring my options
- stuck with creating a new account when I click on "sell"
- oh ok I needed to go on https://www.lulu.com/create
- ok they have Luly Bookstore AND Global Distribution, but for the latter I need copyright, ISBN, and a cover page. I know nothing about ISBN and that copyright page, might be worth investigating
- Global Distribution includes Amazon, which wouldn't be bad, meaning that people can still choose Amazon, but it's not on me
- I picked a title, Stray, set language to English and book category to poetry
- for copyright, they let me pick CC BY NC SA, the same as this digital garden. good
- for ISBN, it's a code meant to identify books... and Lulu provides a free one that will always be tied to them, idc as long as I'm good to go. after generating mine, they give me some download options for a barcode since I'll need to put that code on specific pages of the book
- hit my first roadblock with "Interior File Upload", a PDF with all the interior pages

they offer a book creation guide: [lulu-book-creation-guide.pdf](https://assets.lulu.com/media/guides/en/lulu-book-creation-guide.pdf)

at first glance, it seems pretty easy, especially for my minimalistic poetry book

> If your file does not include graphics, fills, or content that extends
> to the edge of the page, you can prepare your file at the bookâ€™s
> final trim size and our system will automatically add the 0.125
> in/3.175 mm bleed.

I can set up the interior of the book using Google Docs, I just need to decide on the format of the book first

ideally, something small

let's check what they have in small size

| trim name  | trim size       |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| Pocketbook | 108 mm x 175 mm |
| Digest     | 140 mm x 216 mm |
| A5         | 148 mm x 210 mm |
| Royal      | 156 mm x 234 mm |
| US Trade   | 152 mm x 229 mm |
A5 was the easiest to quickly mock-up with a printer sheet and it feels too big already

Digest is almost there

so I'll go with Pocketbook size here, hopefully it's something standard

## chapter 4: formatting the book
it turns out that Google Docs has no support for custom sizes

I am downloading Libre Office, let's see how it goes

I also need to find a good set of fonts that can be used in CC BY NC SA projects

[it seems that all Google Fonts are open source](https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq)

> **Can I use any font in a commercial product?**
> Yes, you can use them commercially, and even include them within a product that is sold commercially. Usage and redistribution conditions are specified in the license. The most common license is the SIL Open Font License. Some fonts are under the Apache license or Ubuntu Font License. You can redistribute open source fonts according to those conditions.

I will be using [Quattrocento](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quattrocento) for titles and [Fanwood Text](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fanwood+Text) for body

I had to fiddle a bit to change from inches to millimeters but I'm good to go now

the page setup requires some more thinking on my end:
- I need to figure out inner margins
- and gutter

gutter size can vary depending on the book's thickness, it's the space left between the spline of the book and the text, and of course thicker books need more space there or you might not be able to read the inner parts of text due to the curvature of the pages

I think my book will be fairly thin, I have about 80 poems

for books of 60 to 150 pages they recommend a gutter size of 16mm. I'm going to put 20 on all sides, and I should be good to go. they also ask for gutter position, either left or right, but I don't know this yet. this leaves me with an open question: when Lulu is talking about the interiors of the books, does it mean my interior PDF should start with the inner cover page?

I can always edit this in the future, for now, I'll just start setting up fonts and the overall book setup

after some fiddling around, I can officially say that I'm having issues with LO formatting, it's very clunky and the text really flows badly. I might want to switch to another word processor

but the font pairing looks good
