I am putting together a poetry book. I have written short poems and stories for the last 15 years or so, and wanted to collect some in a book

you can read the poems [[tags/stray|stray (poetry book)|here]]

I want to self-publish, I don't want to go through an editor or publisher

ideally print on demand, because I can't afford to pre-order a thousand copies and then sell them myself

print on demand meaning that the book is printed once whenever someone orders it, instead of being printed in bulk. also no inventory management

I don't want to use the most widespread option, Amazon's KDP, because it's Amazon and I'm tired of billionaires

I decided to watch a few vids and read some threads on indie publishing, to see what my alternatives are

- [Ranking Print-on-Demand Companies in Self-Publishing from Best to Worst for 2025 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00UrEEfWTzU)
- [3 KDP Alternatives For Publishing Your Low-Content Books - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D43Tt9qM4fw)
- [Seeking Print On Demand Recommendations : r/selfpublish](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfpublish/comments/18gp1gu/seeking_print_on_demand_recommendations/)

here are my notes:
- I'm skipping the notes for KDP 'cuz I won't use them
- I don't really care about my share of the profit since I'll be putting the PDF here for free, but I want to use a fair service
- IngramSpark, 48hbooks, Barnes & Nobles, Lulu, Blurb are some of the alternatives mentioned
- IngramSpark
	- big but average quality
	- low cut
	- poor customer service
	- 
- 48hbooks
	- not really POD
	- special editions, gloss, foil, etc
	- costly
	- you set the cut
- Barnes & Nobles
	- might be using IngramSpark lmao
- Lulu
	- has lots of integrations
	- lots of binding options
	- weeks of delay
- Blurb
	- book templates
	- low paper weights
	-
