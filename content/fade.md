I could’ve done things in many different ways
I had many choices, I picked my own path
this is my way, yet

I feel so different
it’s not like I don’t belong
but more as if I wasn’t even ever here

I know you see ghosts, too

I see them all the time
all at the same time
I see things that once were, and now aren’t
stuff that could've been there
or that will never be

rolling in front of my eyes
as I walk away

thanks for everything
but I won’t ever look back
and you won’t hear me leaving

because I was never there
