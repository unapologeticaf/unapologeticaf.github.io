I thought I had the world in the palm of my hand
I thought I was ready, I thought I had a plan
I thought I was never going to lose myself
until I found myself in that stare of yours

I had been writing and drawing about you long before I met you
you had that something
that something you always hide, except when you are with me

I’m sitting at the window, looking at the snowy rain just outside
I’m crippling my thoughts in this room too small for my dreams
I wrap myself in a blanket, taking one last drag from this cig
I shiver, I thought I was never going to give up

we were just kids
and I had nothing to give you
I couldn’t give you any stability, any sustain
I didn’t have any certainty
I couldn’t save you
I couldn’t take on any of my promises
yet, you did stay, even if it was just for a little while

yet, it couldn’t have ended differently

now I have grown
I have changed, so much you probably wouldn’t even recognize me
I thought you would have missed me, that you would’ve come back to me
that you’d remember me, that you’d find your way to me

doesn’t really matter anymore
I am, and I always will be, selfish
this won’t change, and you did the right thing
I should’ve never looked in those damn green eyes
I should’ve never gifted you those keys, the ones to my heart

now, I can finally stand on my own
now that I could finally give back everything I stole from you
now that I have been working on myself
working on everything I was missing

now, I miss you

*"quore" is a common spelling error with kids (and sometimes adults, too) in Italy, for the word “cuore”, meaning heart. the pronunciation is basically the same. in the song D.A.R.K.N.E.S.S., the rapper Rancore writes about how he has a mistake in his heart, having typed it with the wrong starting letter too*
