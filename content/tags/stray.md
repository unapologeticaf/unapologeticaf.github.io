I just like to write short stories and melancholic poems

I always wanted to put them in a book or something
like those Bukowski reads I held onto as a teen

maybe because I could never manage to write a long story

I used to send some of those, at night
to close friends
or to start close friendships
with SMS, of all means

I wrote most of them at night
some of them while under the influence
some of them while sober. 
most of them I just wrote to express myself. I was an emo kid, after all

I tried publishing some online, but I felt they didn’t belong there, in the open. so, most of what’s in this book has been shown only to a handful of people, most of them gone from my life now. I’m not really a people person

I am writing this before diving deep into my notes and collecting what I think would be my “best” texts. I will probably change something as I go over them

some stories are true; some are fantasy. I won’t tell which ones are what, as I don’t think it’s really important

thanks for reading.
