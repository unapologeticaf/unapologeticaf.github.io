this is the best knight you can get. Liar is an adult here, scarred and bandaged up by so many battles, but he's learned it by now. he know what needs to be done, he is comfortable strategizing alone and he doesn't shy away from his responsibilities. he is a rebel, some kind of know it all, and has replaced his sword with a paintbrush, a sign that he learned that words can be more powerful than just pushing through
